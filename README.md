The Bacteria Adventure is a maze-based game whose primary purpose is to teach a bit about microbiology in a funny way. I designed it mainly for kids in school, but adults can play and have fun either! I am an undergraduate Biomedical Informatics student, and I got the idea for this game while trying to explain some basic concepts of microbiology to my 14-year-old brother. He could not catch my explanation at all, and I realized that a game could explain it much better than my words and some colorless drawings in the paper. The game has three levels, and the main character is a bacteria. As you pass the levels, the difficulty is raised, and some microbiology elements show up, having an essential role in the game. That's how I planned to make it fun, interactive, and full of crucial microbiology elements.

For building this Swift Playground game, I used the SpriteKit framework, which is really cool because I was able to get the concepts and create a cool game in less than a week. Daniela Reis helped me with elements and scenarios design in the game. The theme song is public domain.
